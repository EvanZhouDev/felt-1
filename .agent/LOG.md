# Volta Pipeline Optimization Log

## 2026-06-06 17:21 PDT - Baseline and Goal

- Goal: make the Volta loop converge toward high TRIBE neural similarity efficiently, using Mona Lisa image-to-text as the first proving run, aiming for about 0.9 similarity within roughly 10 iterations and no more than 20.
- Prior baseline from `/Users/evan/Desktop/project-volta`: run `c0f43ac5-9f74-437a-932b-1d7c1bdca646`, remote TRIBE HTTP, image target with cached video, Codex candidates, five iterations.
- Prior best: iteration 4, `candidate-a`, neural similarity `0.0446379915415347`, total score `0.1937465940790743`; the run remained far from `0.9`.
- The initial Mona Lisa target embedding was saved and reused in the old run at `/var/folders/gy/pplhy6xj63l_7f09587mc3900000gn/T/tmp.IchrK0iOvZ/runs/c0f43ac5-9f74-437a-932b-1d7c1bdca646/target.json`.
- This checkout is set up: `bun install`, `bun run check`, `bun run smoke`, `bun run setup:tribe`, and a TRIBE Python import sanity check all passed.
- Current checkout has the descriptive-text prompt fix, but does not yet have the old thread's retry/recovery patches or run visualizer.

Immediate hypotheses:

- Need controlled run tooling before spending real TRIBE/Codex cycles.
- Need robust HTTP TRIBE retry and failed-run recovery so long runs do not waste progress.
- Need richer candidate feedback than "previous selected output + judge reasoning"; agents should see best score, score trend, negative examples, and explicit mutation strategies.
- Need better candidate diversity than `entropy-iteration-index`.
- Need to test whether 0.9 cross-modal image-to-text similarity is even calibrated as reachable; if not, we need to identify the ceiling and avoid optimizing against an impossible target.

## 2026-06-06 17:26 PDT - Robustness Pass 1

Changes in progress:

- Ported HTTP TRIBE retry behavior for transient hosted failures: server restart while job was in flight, resubmitted job messages, and 502/503/504 responses.
- Ported failed-run resume support: the API can resume `failed` runs, and resume can prefer completed per-iteration disk artifacts when `run.json` is stale.

Expected effect:

- Long multi-iteration runs should no longer lose all progress when the hosted TRIBE service restarts mid-score.
- Recovery should continue from the last complete iteration instead of repeating already scored iterations.

Validation:

- `bun run check` passed.
- `bun run smoke` passed.

## 2026-06-06 17:28 PDT - Text Candidate Calibration 1

Added `bun run probe:texts` for scoring arbitrary text probes against a saved target activation without running candidate agents or re-encoding the target.

Probe:

- Target: saved Mona Lisa activation from old run `c0f43ac5-9f74-437a-932b-1d7c1bdca646`.
- Oracle: hosted TRIBE HTTP.
- Texts: 8 hand-written candidates in `.agent/probes/mona-lisa-texts-v1.json`.

Results:

- Best: `prior-best-iteration-4`, neural similarity `0.0446379915415347`.
- Runner-up: `object-list`, neural similarity `0.03276093506673319`.
- Direct title/name description performed poorly: `literal-title` scored `-0.1353451610439663`.
- Literal captions and museum-label prose also failed to beat the old best.

Interpretation:

- Plain semantic accuracy is not enough. The old best seems to have landed on a text style TRIBE likes better than more factual Mona Lisa captions.
- The next search strategy should use larger parallel variation and explicit mutation styles rather than only refining toward a "better description."
- We should add score-history feedback and mutation strategies to candidate prompts before spending on another full Codex+TRIBE loop.

## 2026-06-06 17:33 PDT - Mutation Strategy Pass 1

Changes in progress:

- Replaced generic `entropy-N-M` candidate cues with explicit mutation strategies:
  prior-best-preserving edit, compact visual inventory, spatial composition pass, affect/energy pass, texture/color pass, and negative-control escape.
- Updated candidate prompts to treat refinement as score-driven neural search, not simple description polishing.
- Updated judge prompts to return optimizer-style reasoning: keep/discard/next mutation plus score references.

Expected effect:

- Parallel candidates should explore different text styles instead of converging into near-duplicate portrait prose.
- The next seed should carry more actionable feedback into the following generation.

Validation:

- Initial `bun run check` caught JSON formatter drift in probe reports; fixed with Biome format.
- `bun run check` passed after formatting.
- `bun run smoke` passed with the new mutation cues; selected `candidate-b` in the mock run, which is acceptable because the smoke asserts judge selection follows ranking rather than a fixed candidate id.

## 2026-06-06 17:39 PDT - Search Algorithm Research Pass

User nudge: research existing genetic/evolutionary algorithms, including AlphaEvolve, and optionally create a human-readable log.

Sources checked:

- Google DeepMind AlphaEvolve blog and white paper.
- MAP-Elites paper by Mouret and Clune.
- Novelty Search paper by Lehman and Stanley.
- CMA-ES reference site.

Takeaways:

- AlphaEvolve's important pattern for Volta is a scored archive/database plus prompt sampling from parent and inspiration candidates, not one-winner-only refinement.
- MAP-Elites suggests keeping elite outputs per behavior/style cell so exploration survives while still improving quality.
- Novelty search is relevant because the 0.9 objective may be deceptive or poorly calibrated; we should preserve diverse candidates even when they are not immediate score winners.
- CMA-ES is less directly applicable to raw text, but useful for tunable strategy distributions and mutation strengths.

Added `.agent/HUMAN_LOG.md` with a readable summary and source links.

## 2026-06-06 17:43 PDT - Target Activation Cache

Changes in progress:

- Added a target activation cache under `<runsRoot>/../target-cache/<renderedSha>.json`.
- `buildTarget` now renders the target first, checks the cache by rendered stimulus hash, and reuses the cached activation if present.
- On cache hit, the run still writes its own `target.json` with the current rendered target plus cached activation.

Expected effect:

- Repeated parameter experiments for the same Mona Lisa target should not re-encode the target video.
- This is a general optimization for any repeated stable input target, not a Mona Lisa special case.

Validation:

- `bun run smoke` passed.
- Initial `bun run check` found one formatting wrap in `run.ts`; fixed with Biome format.
- `bun run check` passed after formatting.

## 2026-06-06 17:49 PDT - Candidate Archive Pass 1

Changes in progress:

- Added a persisted per-run `candidate-archive.json`.
- Archive entries track iteration, agent id, neural similarity, total score, output type, compact text, and behavior descriptors.
- Behavior keys currently bucket text outputs by length, sentence style, proper-name usage, and emphasis style.
- Candidate prompts now receive compact top/diverse/recent archive slices when available.

Expected effect:

- The loop can exploit top candidates without losing diversity.
- Later iterations should have evidence beyond the single selected previous seed.
- This is the first concrete step toward an AlphaEvolve/MAP-Elites-style candidate database.

## 2026-06-06 17:56 PDT - Progress Tracking Moved to Notion

User requested that the human-readable progress log live in Notion instead of `.agent/HUMAN_LOG.md`.

Actions:

- Updated Notion page `3789a760-ad80-80e6-bfa0-eacbb8cab5b8` with the current progress summary via `ntn pages update`.
- Removed `.agent/HUMAN_LOG.md` from the branch to avoid maintaining two human-facing logs.
- Kept `.agent/LOG.md` as the detailed local experiment/audit log.

Validation:

- `bun run smoke` passed with archive wiring.
- Initial `bun run check` found formatter drift in `archive.ts`; fixed with Biome format.
- `bun run check` passed after formatting.
- Smoke artifact wrote `candidate-archive.json` with 4 entries across the two smoke iterations.

## 2026-06-06 18:00 PDT - Bounded Real Run 1 Exposed Scoring Observability Bug

Run attempted:

- Run id: `353ee43a-86b2-45d4-823b-efaa43747d04`
- Hosted TRIBE HTTP, Codex backend, Mona Lisa cached target, 4 candidates, 2 max iterations.
- Target cache worked: run moved quickly into `predicting`, then `scoring`.
- Candidate diversity improved: generated compact inventory, spatial composition, affect/energy, and restrained portrait candidates.

Problem:

- Run stayed in `scoring` after remote TRIBE queue cleared.
- No `scores.json` existed because the code only writes scores after all candidates finish.
- This creates all-or-nothing scoring observability and wastes recoverable partial progress.

Changes in progress:

- Added 30s bounded fetches around hosted TRIBE submit, job polling, artifact fetch, and prediction download.
- Marked timeout/abort errors as retryable for the existing HTTP retry loop.
- Added per-candidate score snapshots under `iterations/<NNN>/scores/<agent>.json` immediately after each candidate finishes scoring.

Validation:

- `bun run check` passed.
- `bun run smoke` passed.
- Smoke artifacts include per-candidate score snapshots for both iterations.

## 2026-06-06 18:05 PDT - Salvaged Candidate Probe From Stuck Run

Instead of launching new Codex generations, salvaged the four generated candidates from stuck run `353ee43a-86b2-45d4-823b-efaa43747d04` and scored them sequentially with `bun run probe:texts`.

Results:

- `candidate-b` compact visual inventory: `0.017743644507674988`.
- `candidate-a` restrained portrait prose: `-0.011906040739213029`.
- `candidate-d` affect/energy prose: `-0.024936240237532242`.
- `candidate-c` spatial composition prose: `-0.08631622091198896`.

Interpretation:

- Mutation strategies produced meaningfully different text forms, but none beat the old best `0.0446379915415347`.
- Compact inventory is promising relative to the other fresh candidates, but still not enough.
- New runs should not start from an empty archive for the same target. We need a target-specific archive or imported prior elite so repeated experiments exploit known good candidates immediately.

## 2026-06-06 18:09 PDT - Target-Specific Archive Pass

Changes in progress:

- Extended candidate archives with optional `runId`.
- Added target-specific archives under `<runsRoot>/../target-archives/<targetSha>.json`.
- Candidate prompts now merge target-specific archive entries with the current run archive.
- New scored candidates append to both the run archive and the target archive.

Expected effect:

- Repeated experiments on the same target can reuse prior elites immediately.
- Mona Lisa experiments can begin with the known `0.0446379915415347` text in context instead of rediscovering it.
- This is closer to AlphaEvolve's persistent program database, but scoped by target hash to avoid cross-target contamination.

Validation:

- `bun run smoke` passed.
- Initial `bun run check` found formatter drift in `archive.ts`; fixed with Biome format.
- `bun run check` passed after formatting.
- Smoke artifact created a target-specific archive with 4 entries and `runId: smoke-run`.
